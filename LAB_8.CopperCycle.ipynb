    "precipitation reactions.  The main part of your post-lab is writing down balanced net ionic equations and classifying their type. The only calculation needed is to determine the percent recovery of copper in your final step.  This is a pretty easy calculation to do, and you certainly don't need to write any code to help you.  However, in case you want to practice using python at all, you can use this simple notebook. "
