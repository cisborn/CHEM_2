    "In this lab, you will use a series of reactions to synthesize potassium aluminum sulfate dodecahydrate (alum) from aluminum, learning some filtration techniques in the process. Some of the hard work is done in the pre-lab, where you will determine how to adapt and scale the procedure to acheive a theoretical yield of 15.0 g of alum, figuring what initial mass of aluminum you will need to measure out in the lab. The only calculation to do at the end of the lab is the percent yield based on the limiting reagent; your limiting reagent in this experiment is the initial aluminum metal. This is a pretty easy calculation to do, and you certainly don't need to write any code to help you.  However, in case you want to practice using python at all, you can use this simple notebook.  "
